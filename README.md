A drug recommendation system is a technological solution that helps doctors prescribe the right drugs to patients based on their demographics, history of illness, symptoms, and drug efficacy, among other things.
The system analyses massive datasets, including patient data, medication profiles, clinical research, and drug-drug interactions, among others, by using sophisticated algorithms and methodologies. 
This innovative approach analyses user sentiment and emotions in text data by using big data and sophisticated analytics. 
As a result, a drug recommendation system is now required to assist doctors and patients in understanding how different medications may affect their medical conditions.
It makes utilization of client surveys to anticipate customized remedies and comprehend feelings. 
Sentiment analysis and feature engineering are used by drug recommender systems to identify patients with certain conditions and provide the right medication.

 **Algorithms Implemented**
 i)Passive Aggressive Classifier: The Passive Aggressive Classifier operates by iteratively updating its model parameters to minimize loss while making predictions. In the context of a drug recommendation system, PAC
can be applied to classify drug reviews as positive or negative based on user ratings. Initially, the classifier is trained on labeled data, where it learns to distinguish between positive and negative ratings. During training,
if a misclassification occurs, the model updates its parameters aggressively to correct the mistake. However, when correctly classified instances are encountered, the model remains passive and does not update its
parameters. This unique behavior allows PAC to adapt quickly to changing data patterns while maintaining efficiency. In the drug recommendation system, PAC can effectively classify reviews, aiding in the generation
of accurate medication recommendations based on user ratings. The system benefits from PAC's ability to handle large datasets and adapt to evolving user preferences, ultimately enhancing the overall performance
and reliability of the recommendation process.

ii)Multinomial Naive Bayes: : Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is a probabilistic classifier commonly used in text classification tasks, including drug recommendation systems. It operates based on the assumption that
features are conditionally independent given the class label. In the context of drug reviews, MNB assigns probabilities to each word's occurrence in a review given the class label (positive or negative rating). These
probabilities are estimated from the training data using a multinomial distribution. During classification, MNB calculates the probability of a review belonging to each class using Bayes' theorem and selects the class with
the highest probability as the predicted rating for the review. Within drug recommendation systems, Multinomial Naive Bayes demonstrates efficiency in handling extensive text data. It rapidly categorizes
reviews as either positive or negative, relying on their associated ratings. This capability significantly enhances the system's accuracy in delivering personalized and precise medication recommendations, aligning with
individual preferences and requirements.
